-- 3. Run: migration_jobs_to_internships.sql
-- 4. Verify success
```

### 3. Testing 🧪
**Reference**: `REFACTORING_COMPLETE.md` (Testing Checklist section)

Test areas:
- [ ] Backend API endpoints
- [ ] Frontend UI and flows
- [ ] Database queries
- [ ] End-to-end user journey

### 4. Deployment 🌐
**Guide**: `REFACTORING_COMPLETE.md` (Deployment Steps section)

Deploy order:

## 📚 DOCUMENTATION GUIDE

| File | Purpose | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **README.md** | Project overview | First-time setup |
| **API_DOCS.md** | API reference | Integration work |
| **ARCHITECTURE.md** | System design | Understanding structure |
| **DATABASE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md** | Quick migration | **Use this NOW** |
| **REFACTORING_COMPLETE.md** | Full deployment guide | Deployment time |
| **TERMINOLOGY_REFACTORING_COMPLETE.md** | Detailed changes | Reference for what changed |

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL REMINDER

### Before You Proceed:
1. ✅ **Backup your Supabase database** (Dashboard → Database → Backups)
2. ✅ **Test in development first** (if you have a staging environment)
3. ✅ **Have rollback script ready** (included in migration file)

### Why This Matters:
The database migration is the **only irreversible step**. Once the table is renamed from `jobs` to `internships`, all backend services will expect the new name.

---

## 🎨 WHAT CHANGED (User-Facing)

### Before Refactoring:
- "Search for Jobs" button
- "Job Selected" messages  
- "View Job Posting" links
- API endpoint: `/jobs/search`

### After Refactoring:
- "Search for Internships" button
- "Internship Selected" messages
- "View Internship Posting" links
- API endpoint: `/internships/search`

---

## 🔧 WHAT CHANGED (Technical)

### API Endpoints
```diff
- GET /jobs/search
+ GET /internships/search

- GET /jobs/{id}
+ GET /internships/{id}
```

### Database Schema
```diff
- CREATE TABLE jobs (...)
+ CREATE TABLE internships (...)

- emails.job_id REFERENCES jobs(id)
+ emails.internship_id REFERENCES internships(id)
```

### Frontend Components
```diff
- <JobCard job={...} />
+ <InternshipCard internship={...} />

- const [selectedJob, setSelectedJob] = useState(...)
+ const [selectedInternship, setSelectedInternship] = useState(...)
```

---

## ✨ BENEFITS ACHIEVED

1. **Semantic Clarity**: Code accurately represents business domain
2. **User Understanding**: Students immediately know this is for internships
3. **Developer Experience**: New developers understand codebase faster
4. **SEO Optimization**: Better keyword alignment for internship searches
5. **Brand Consistency**: Platform message aligns with target audience

---

## 📊 IMPACT SUMMARY

| Area | Files Changed | Impact |
|------|---------------|--------|
| Backend Models | 3 | Low risk - type definitions |
| Backend Routes | 4 | Medium risk - endpoints renamed |
| Backend Services | 3 | Low risk - internal logic |
| Frontend Components | 1 | Low risk - UI display |
| Frontend API | 1 | Medium risk - API calls |
| Frontend Pages | 3 | Low risk - UI text |
| Database Schema | 3 | **HIGH RISK - REQUIRES MIGRATION** |
| Documentation | 5 | No risk - reference only |
