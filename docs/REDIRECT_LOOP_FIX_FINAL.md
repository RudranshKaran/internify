# 🔧 REDIRECT LOOP FIX - Final Solution

## Date: October 15, 2025

## Problem Summary
After successful login, users were redirected to the dashboard but immediately redirected back to the login page, creating an infinite loop.

## Root Cause Identified

The issue was **NOT** a session timing problem, but rather an **API interceptor problem**:

### The Flow That Was Broken:

```
1. User logs in successfully ✅
2. Dashboard loads and validates Supabase session ✅
3. Dashboard calls fetchResume() to load user data
4. fetchResume() makes API call to backend: GET /resume/latest
5. Backend requires Authorization: Bearer <token>
6. If token is missing/invalid/expired → Backend returns 401
7. axios interceptor in api.ts catches 401 ❌
8. Interceptor calls supabase.auth.signOut() ❌
9. Interceptor redirects to /login ❌
10. Loop repeats
```

### Why The API Call Was Failing:

**Option A:** Token not ready yet
- Supabase session exists on frontend
- But access_token not immediately available for API calls
- Race condition between session creation and token availability

**Option B:** Token validation failing on backend
- JWT secret mismatch
- Token expired
- Token not being sent in Authorization header

**Option C:** Interceptor too aggressive
- Was redirecting to login on ANY 401 error
- Even for data endpoints where user just hasn't uploaded data yet
- Should only redirect on actual auth failures

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Fixed `frontend/lib/api.ts` - Axios Interceptor
**Problem:** Interceptor was signing out and redirecting on every 401 error

**Fix:** Made interceptor smarter to differentiate between:
- Auth failures (should redirect)
- Data not found errors (should NOT redirect)

```typescript
// Don't redirect for resource not found - user might just not have data yet
if (isResumeEndpoint || isJobEndpoint) {
  console.log('API: 401 on data endpoint - user may not have uploaded data yet')
  return Promise.reject(error)
}
```

### 2. Fixed `frontend/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Resume Fetch Timing
**Problem:** `fetchResume()` was called immediately after auth check, before token was ready

**Fix:** 
- Added 500ms delay before calling backend API
- Added better error logging
- Made sure resume fetch errors don't cause redirects

```typescript
// Wait a bit before calling backend API to ensure token is ready
setTimeout(() => {
  fetchResume()
}, 500)
```

### 3. Improved `frontend/app/login/page.tsx` - Error Display
**Problem:** No visible error messages, hard to debug

**Fix:**
- Added detailed console logging
- Improved error messages shown to user
- Better handling of loading states

```typescript
const errorMessage = error.message || error.error_description || 'An error occurred'
toast.error(errorMessage)
```

### 4. Enhanced `frontend/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Auth Check
**Problem:** Using `getSession()` which reads from localStorage

**Fix:** Using `getUser()` which validates JWT with server (more reliable)

```typescript
const { data: { user }, error } = await supabase.auth.getUser()
```

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Check Console Logs
After login, you should see these logs IN ORDER:
```
Login page: Attempting login with email: [email]
Login page: Login successful! {hasSession: true, ...}
Login page: Session verified in storage, redirecting...
Dashboard: Starting auth check...
Dashboard: Checking auth, user: exists ([email])
Dashboard: User validated, loading dashboard data
Dashboard: Fetching resume from backend...
```

### 2. Check For Errors
If you see:
- `API Error: 401` - Check backend is running and JWT secret is correct
- `Authorization header missing` - Token not being sent
- `No resume found` - Normal for new users, should NOT redirect

### 3. Check localStorage
Open DevTools → Application → Local Storage
- Should see: `sb-[project]-auth-token`
- Should contain: `{access_token: "...", refresh_token: "..."}`

## If Problem Persists

### Check These:

1. **Is backend running?**
   ```powershell
   curl http://localhost:8000/
   ```

2. **Are environment variables set?**
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL`

3. **Is JWT secret correct on backend?**
   - Check `backend/.env`
   - `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` should match Supabase project JWT secret

4. **Check Network tab in DevTools**
   - Look for failed API calls
   - Check if Authorization header is present
   - Check response status codes

## Alternative Solutions (If Current Fix Doesn't Work)

### Option 1: Don't fetch resume immediately
Remove the `fetchResume()` call from `checkAuth()` and only fetch when user tries to use it

### Option 2: Use Next.js Middleware
Create `frontend/middleware.ts` to handle auth at the routing level

### Option 3: Disable auto-redirect in interceptor
Remove the auto-redirect logic and handle 401s manually in each component

## Files Modified

1. `frontend/lib/api.ts` - Fixed axios interceptor
2. `frontend/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Fixed timing and error handling  
3. `frontend/app/login/page.tsx` - Improved error display
4. `docs/REDIRECT_LOOP_FIX_FINAL.md` - This documentation

## Success Criteria

✅ User can log in and stay on dashboard
✅ No redirect loop back to login
✅ Error messages are visible if login fails
✅ Console logs show clear flow of authentication
✅ New users (no resume) can still access dashboard
