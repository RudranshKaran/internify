## üéØ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Infinite Redirect Loop
**Files**: `AUTH_LOOP_FINAL_FIX.md`, `REDIRECT_LOOP_FIX_FINAL.md`

**Problem**: Users getting stuck in redirect loop between login and dashboard

**Solution**: 
- Fixed auth state checking logic
- Prevented multiple simultaneous redirects
- Used `window.location.replace()` instead of `router.push()`

---

### Issue: Resume Upload Failures
**Files**: `RESUME_UPLOAD_BUCKET_FIX.md`, `RESUME_UPLOAD_TOKEN_FIX.md`

**Problem**: Resume uploads failing with 401 errors

**Solution**:
- Configured Supabase storage bucket policies correctly
- Fixed JWT token passing in upload requests
- Updated RLS policies for authenticated users

---

### Issue: Login Not Working
**Files**: `LOGIN_FIX.md`, `LOGIN_FIX_ENHANCED.md`, `AUTH_FIXES_FINAL.md`

**Problem**: Users unable to log in or session not persisting

**Solution**:
- Used `getUser()` instead of `getSession()` for better validation
- Implemented proper session checking
- Fixed token refresh logic

---

### Issue: Window Location Errors
**Files**: `FINAL_FIX_WINDOW_LOCATION.md`

**Problem**: Window location causing errors in server-side rendering

**Solution**:
- Added proper client-side checks
- Used `useEffect` for window operations
- Prevented SSR errors

---

### Issue: Session Storage Problems
**Files**: `ULTIMATE_FIX_SESSIONSTORAGE.md`

**Problem**: Session data not persisting correctly

**Solution**:
- Switched from sessionStorage to localStorage where needed
- Fixed data persistence across page reloads

## üéì Lessons Learned

### Authentication
- Always use `getUser()` for validation, not just `getSession()`
- Prevent multiple simultaneous auth checks with refs
- Use `window.location.replace()` for auth redirects

### File Uploads
- Configure storage buckets BEFORE implementing upload
- RLS policies must match your folder structure
- Always pass JWT token in upload headers

### Frontend State
- Use `useEffect` for window/document operations
- Check if running in browser before accessing window
- localStorage persists better than sessionStorage

### Debugging
- Add comprehensive console.logs during development
- Document fixes immediately while fresh
- Test auth flows thoroughly (login ‚Üí dashboard ‚Üí refresh)
