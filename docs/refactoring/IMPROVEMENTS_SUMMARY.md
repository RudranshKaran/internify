## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

### Critical Tests Needed
1. **Resume Operations:**
   - [ ] Upload resume → verify success
   - [ ] Replace resume → verify new file uploaded
   - [ ] Delete resume → verify removed from storage and DB
   - [ ] Try to delete another user's resume (should fail)

2. **Job Selection:**
   - [ ] Click job card → verify selection state
   - [ ] Click different card → verify state updates
   - [ ] Click "Generate Email" → verify navigation

3. **Email Flow:**
   - [ ] Select job → generate email → verify AI content
   - [ ] Edit email fields → send → verify in history
   - [ ] Check sent email in Resend dashboard

4. **Legal Pages:**
   - [ ] Visit /privacy → verify content loads
   - [ ] Visit /terms → verify content loads
   - [ ] Click footer links → verify navigation

### Edge Cases to Test
- Upload non-PDF file (should show error)
- Search with empty query (should prevent search)
- Delete resume while job results showing (should clear jobs)
- Navigate to /email-preview without selection (should redirect)
- Send email without editing recipient (should use default)
