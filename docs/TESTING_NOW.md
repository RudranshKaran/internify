# 🧪 Quick Testing Guide - Login Fix

## ✅ All Issues Fixed!

### What Was Fixed:
1. ✅ **Login redirect loop** - Changed from `router.push()` to `window.location.href`
2. ✅ **Dashboard redirect issue** - All auth checks now use full page reloads
3. ✅ **Documentation organized** - All fix docs moved to `/docs` folder

---

## 🚀 Test Now

### Step 1: Clear Your Browser
Open browser console (F12) and run:
```javascript
localStorage.clear()
sessionStorage.clear()
location.reload()
```

### Step 2: Test Login
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/login
2. Enter your credentials
3. Click "Sign In"

**✅ Expected Result:**
- Toast message: "Logged in successfully!"
- Redirect to dashboard after 0.5 seconds
- Dashboard loads and **STAYS** there
- **NO** redirect back to login

**❌ If you see problems:**
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Look for console logs starting with "Dashboard:"
- Check if you see continuous GET requests in Network tab

### Step 3: Check Terminal
Look at your terminal where `npm run dev` is running.

**✅ Should see:**
```
GET /login 200 in XXms
GET /dashboard 200 in XXms
[stops here - no more requests]
```

**❌ Should NOT see:**
```
GET /dashboard 200
GET /login 200
GET /dashboard 200
GET /login 200
... (repeating)
```

## 🔍 What Changed

### Before (Broken):
```tsx
// Using router.push() - client-side navigation
router.push('/dashboard')
```
**Problem**: Session not ready → Dashboard redirects back → Loop!

### After (Fixed):
```tsx
// Using window.location.href - full page reload
window.location.href = '/dashboard'
```
**Solution**: Full reload → Session ready → Dashboard stays!

---

## 📊 Expected Console Logs

When you login and go to dashboard, you should see:

```
Dashboard: Checking auth, session: exists
Dashboard: Session found, user: your-email@example.com
```

If you try to access dashboard while logged out:

```
Dashboard: Checking auth, session: none
Dashboard: No session, redirecting to login
```

## 🎯 Quick Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still seeing redirect loop
**Solution**: 
1. Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
2. Clear storage (see Step 1 above)
3. Close and reopen browser

### Issue: "Session not found" in console
**Solution**: 
- Check your `.env.local` file
- Verify Supabase credentials are correct
- Try logging in again

### Issue: Page loads but shows blank screen
**Solution**:
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Make sure backend is running (if needed)
- Verify resume API is working
